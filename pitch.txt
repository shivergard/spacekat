interstellar
being in space is lonely
you need some kind of pet

features
it's going to ignore you
it's going to be loud
it's going to scratch surface around
to detect closed doors 
I'm thinking of chewing wires
fancy carpet to vomit
toys that it's going to lose
microtransactions

#script

roll around on the floor
sit down
speaker calls it to jump on the seat
ignored
meow
let me out you idiot
wait for open door
wait some time
"vomit" on the floor?
reverse, drive away
meow meow
show ads?
